Trapped in an underground maze
have to find the 3 keys

first key: 

You wake up, dazed,  you head throbbing. You sit up on the hard, cold floor, before looking around you. There's a faint glowiing light bulb hung above, leaving half the room in eternal shadow.

Beware your two queens,
Beware your power.
You claws will betray you,
In your final hour.

Beware the darkness of dragons,
Beware the stalker of dreams.
Beware one with the talons of power and fire,
Beware one who is not what she seems.

Something is coming to shake the earth,
Something is coming to scorch the ground.
Jade mountain will fall under thunder and ice,
Unless the lost city of night can be found.

Turn your eyes, your wings, your fire,
To the land across the sea,
Where dragons are poisoned and dragons are dying,
And no one can ever be free.

A secret lurks inside their eggs,
A secret hides within their book.
A secret buried far below,
May save those brave enough to look.

Open your hearts, your minds, your wings,
To the dragons who flee from the Hive.
Face a great evil with talons united,
Or none of the tribes will survive.
