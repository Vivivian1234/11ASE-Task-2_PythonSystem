# Spawn Text
You wake up, the last thing you remember is suffocating in gassy fabric, closing in from behind. This place looks familiar, you have definitely been here sometime before, but you can't seem to remember anything. The yellowish wallpaper and the cold floor all feel so homely, but that doesn't matter now. Your name... What is your name? Why can't you remember anything and yet everything seems so familiar?
<br>**Good, at least you remember your name.**
 ## Options

- Bathroom

# Bathroom
You enter a broken down bathroom, completely unusale. There’s mould on the toilet and sink, the shower head is smashed. The once white tiles are now brown, covered in dirt and grime. And… what is that white thing sticking out of the sink?
## Options
- Grab
- Leave

### If you pick up the bone
You approach the 'white thing', peering into the sink, discovering that it was actually a large bone. The bottom part of it was stuck inside the drain. Huh. Wonder how that got here? You ran your fingers across the smooth white object, and then lightly tugged at it. When the bone didn't budge, you then tried pulling the bone, and after some effort, the bone was finally from free from the sink. It probably would be come useful later, you decided, and shoved it into your pouch.

# Dog room
You enter a room with a huge black dog with glowing red eyes. You don’t notice the dog at first, its fur colour blending in with the shadows. As you approached the spot where the dog stood, it barked aggressively at you. You jumped back, finally noticing the creature. Then you realise it was tied up with a metal chain to a pole. The dog howled in pain as you approached and growled as you reached out for it. But his mouth was watering when he spotted the bone in your pouch.
## Options
- Give
- Leave
### If you give the dog the bone
The black doggo gobbles up the bone and wags its tail at you, no longer aggressive. You pat the dog (awww) and free him from the pole. The dog runs off the who knows where and reveals a key underneath the spot he was standing on. You knew the key would be useful and grabbed it. You heard a small metal object drop to the ground as the dog disappears from sight. You follow it, and is greeted by a small, shining metal pen on the floor. It looks delicate, and you are careful when you pick it up, afraid to damage it. The fancy writing on the pen read "Laser Pen". Laser Pen? What could that be...? You put the pen in your pocket.

# Friendly Barista's Cafe
You enter this spotless cafe.
A barista with calm, blank eyes greets you.
<br> “Greetings, I am Friendly Barista. Would you like some coffee? It’s on the house.”
<br> Friendly Barista offers you a coffee, you ask about the kidnapping and keys but he acts clueless, but still smiling as laid back as ever.
## Options
- Take the coffee and leave
- Ignore the friendly barista and leave

# Andy's Room
You enter a dirty room full of mould, sweaty and dirty clothes, empty, unwashed coffee mugs and yellowed open books. It reeks of coffee and expired milk. You see a tired guy in a bad mood.
<br> “Ugh… I’m so tired…” he groans.
<br> You ask about the keys
<br> “Oh… gimme a coffee and I’ll give you the clue to the key… Zzz”

## Options  
- Give the tired guy a coffee
- Go out of the room because you don’t have any coffee	

### If you give Tired Guy the coffee
He drinks it immediately, and gives you back the cup. 
<br> "Thanks for the coffee, the name's Andy, by the way"
<br>He gives you a small piece of paper. It's a riddle scribbled in messy handwriting. It reads: "Look at me and I'll look at you, no matter what, no matter who, you'll always see that there'll be two. To find the key, you must know yourself well. If you don't, you'll be locked in this cell! What am I?"

# Bathroom
You release the answer the riddle must be the mirror. You bolt back to the bathroom and pull the mirror off the wall. It swings open, revealing a small hole containing the second key


# Key 2

# Party Room red herring
You enter a brightly coloured room with helium balloons and a tall clown who has a bright rainbow wig and a giant red nose. The tall clown is smiling a big, bright, red smile. Making eye contact with you as you walk across the room, however, this tall clown  does not make any effort to provoke you, rendering it harmless. In the centre of the room, there is a 5-layer birthday cake. It looks and smells a bit stale, but it still is as bright as a fresh one and looks absolutely delicious. You mouth waters as you approach it, but as you get closer, you realise the sugary icing spells out "**HAPPY BIRTHDAY; DO NOT EAT ME**" but the cake looks so good, and you're a bit hungry, your mouth starts watering just thinking about the cake. Would it hurt just to take a single slice?
## Options
- Eat
- Talk
- Leave

### If you eat the cake
You eat the cake. Your tongue goes on a flavour adventure with all the yummy sweet flavours of the 5 layers, eat bite gets better and better, melting in your mouth. You want to eat the whole cake. However, your gag reflexes stop you. You start vomiting non-stop all over the room, the tall clown looks at you with a disgusted face. Your breath hitched and your vision goes blurry and you start tearing up. You feel like you have just been hit by a heavy blunt object and your entire body is on fire. Everything goes black. You wake up, the last thing you remember is eating the most delicious cake you have ever eaten and passing out right after, everything else in your memory seems to go to a blur.
### If you talk to the tall clown
You try to start a conversation with the tall clown that is eyeing you. You ask about the 5-layer cake with the strange iced message. The tall clown nods, he warns you not to eat the cake. He looks like he he is on the verge of tears, his watery eyes were sparkling and his delicate voice trembling. Was eating this cake that bad? Oh well. The clown seems really desperate for you to not eat the cake, so you leave the cake and the party room. As you close the door, you hear a huge sigh of relief from the tall clown. 
### If you leave the room
You sneaked a quick glance at the tall clown and your eyes met. His gaze looks pleading as if he doesn't want you to do something foolish, but you don't know what. You never find out as you left the room, closing the door behind you. You hear a faint sigh of relief behind the door. Odd. What was the clown hiding?

# Key 3

# Kitchen
You enter the kitchen and see an angry italian man staring right into your eyes. He says he has been tied there for days and that he knows the code. You ask what code and he says the code to open the cookbook which contains the secret code. You say you will make hima pizza but he must give you he code in exchange, he aggrees and you get to work. Firstly, what is your favourite type of pizza from the options below, remember, we only have a certain amount of ingreients.

# Gym (Red herring :D)
You enter the gym and greeted with the unpleasant smell of old sweat and decide to ignore. You continue exploring when you come across a treadmill and weights scattered everywhere. you assume this is where your kidnapper trained his men and now you have a tough decision to make to have a workout and be fit for where you believe you are met with the kidnapper’s men or you can wait it out and explore the rest of this oddly designed place.

# Library
You are greeted by a friendly woman who points you in the direction of the non-fiction books, you follow her and you inspect the shelves, you see books about history, animals and architecture, but you see a gap in the shelf. Who could possibly have borrowed a book from here? You look around and the librarian is nowhere to be found, so you look at your backpack, for things in their that might help you. Actually, what would help you?
## Options 
- Leave room and go back into the hallway
- Place an object into the missing slot
- Leave find the librarian

### Decisions

- You place the cookbook into the slot and the bookshelf creaks open revealing the key, but suddenly the librarian reappears and you see a pair of round fluffy ears on her head. You back away from her, confusion flashes across your face. Wasn’t the librarian a normal human before? You take another glance at her, and notice her face going pale and a dark circle growing around her eyes. Then realisation hit. She’s transforming into a panda. The librarian-turned-panda is strangely adorable, but that was only until it growled at you, and you took another step back. The black and white creature stands protectively in front of the key, as if she’s guarding it. Oh. She IS guarding it. But how does one retrieve a key from an aggressive panda who could probably chomp someone’s hand off in one bite? Your only solution was to knock it out, against your will. You have to, to get out of here alive. You don’t have a choice. The panda suddenly lunges out at you, as quick as a bird. You dodge, but barely. The animal flies past you, crashing into a bookshelf, knocking it over. The bookshelf shook and collapsed, and a bucket of books were dumped onto the panda’s head. A particularly large old looking book fell on her head, knocking her out. Well, that saves you the trouble of abusing a cute furry animal at least. You head over to the panda (librarian?) and lifts the bookshelf off her. It took some effort though, that giant piece of wood isn’t the lightest thing in the world. You then proceeded to lift a heavy panda onto a nearby couch, making sure she’s okay. Gosh, you should become a professional weightlifter at this point. You turned around, grabbed the little golden key from behind the fake bookshelf-door, and left the library.

- You look for the librarian and she is nowhere to be found, she appears to have vanished, maybe she knows something about the key?

# Diamond Room
You open the 3 locks in the cellar.
There is a peculiar looking safe on a table inside of the otherwise empty room. 
You use the laser pen to cut the safe in half.
The safe opens, with a strange blue diamond inside. It shines a bright blue glow in every direction, as if producing it's own light. 
You reach to grab it, but a bark distracts you. You turn around, delighted to see the puppy from the other room. It licks your hand and jumps into your arms. You touch the diamond and you suddendly get transported onto your bed, back in your own home. You have a good night's sleep with your new furry friend Teddy by your side.

You wake up in the morning and turn on this morning's news. It reads:

"FRIENDLY BARISTA, TIRED 'ANDY' GUY AND TALL CLOWN KILLED IN FREAK ACCIDENT. AUTHORITIES STILL INVESTIGATING CAUSE OF DEATH."
